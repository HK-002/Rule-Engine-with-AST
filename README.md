# Rule-Engine-with-AST

The Rule Evaluation Engine is a backend application built using Spring Boot that allows users to create, combine, and evaluate business rules against user data. The application leverages an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to interpret and execute complex logical expressions defined as rules. Although the frontend is not implemented, the backend functionality has been thoroughly tested using Postman.
